					<p>If you&rsquo;re a website owner, you probably know that the number of people who visit your site every day is a key factor in determining how successful your business is. But what if there was an easy way to improve your site&rsquo;s SEO?</p>
					<p>Structured data gives search engines like Google and Bing more information about your content so they can understand more about it and therefore provide better search results. Let's know more about it.</p>
					<h2><strong>What is Structured Data?</strong></h2>
					<p>Structured data is a set of standards for describing data on web pages in machine-readable form. The premise behind structured data is that web pages should be able to be read by search engines and other software tools using specific vocabularies, which are then used to make decisions about the relevance of a page or content within its context.</p>
					<p>In addition to allowing for more accurate searches, structured data can help you get found by search engines when people use their natural language skills to find what they need online. This element of your website provides information about the content on your site, such as:</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Title, Description, and Keywords for each article or product on your site.</li>
					<li>Types of products you sell (books, music, etc.)</li>
					<li>Keywords for each product or service you offer.</li>
					<li>Locations where you operate (city/state/country)</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><strong>How you can Optimize your Website's SEO Using Structured Data?</strong></h2>
					<p>This requires careful planning and optimization of your website&rsquo;s content and structure. Here are some steps to optimize your website using structured data:</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Use the &ldquo;Description&rdquo; Element</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The &ldquo;description&rdquo; element provides a brief description of the content on your site. This can include things like keywords and phrases that describe the content or product being sold on your site as well as meta descriptions that tell users exactly what they should expect when they click through to another page on your site. It can also include any other important information about the page such as its category, author or publication date, etc.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Find More Relevant Schema Mark-ups for your Site</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The second step to optimizing your website&rsquo;s SEO is to find out what structured data mark-up is available for your site. Structured data is a standardized set of information stored on the web, which allows it to be accessed by search engines and other applications. Search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! are using structured data mark-up in their search results pages as well as their mobile apps. To know more about it,<strong> <a href="https://brucejonesseo.com/structured-data-seo/">check it out</a></strong>.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li><strong>Try the Google Mark-up Tool</strong></li>
					</ul>
					<p>To find out what structured data mark-up is available for your site, you can use Google&rsquo;s Structured Data Testing Tool (SDTT). This tool looks at the elements specified in the schema and returns whether they are found on the page or not. You can enter a URL or file name and get back results instantly.</p>
					<p>Fourthly, define the content of your mark-up tags, code it or use a plug-in if necessary. Finally, validate your mark-up code before running an SEO audit on your site.</p>
					<p>Thus, it's important to include structured data in your website in order to optimize it for SEO and help it rank better in search engines. At present, it is not just an optional feature of your website &mdash; it&rsquo;s essential if you want to increase your traffic and rankings.</p>
